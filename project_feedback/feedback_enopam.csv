REINFORCEMENT: I like that...	I like that the group included an overview at the beginning.  Very unique touch that engages people and sets expectations.  Conclusion included persuasive points.  Pace felt good.	IMPROVEMENT: I wish that...  It would be cool if...	?	UNCLEAR: I'm unsure about... Could you explain more about...	"How will the different entities (Maize, Korn Krib, etc) post their items and prices?"	ALTERNATIVES: Have you considered...	-
REINFORCEMENT: I like that...	This idea is great! It seems like you have a good idea of what you want in the design of the website.	IMPROVEMENT: I wish that...  It would be cool if...	"Maybe even putting some sort of student marketplace as well. If a student would like to sell an old textbook or something, they could list it on the website that focuses on the cobber audience."	UNCLEAR: I'm unsure about... Could you explain more about...	What items would you be selling in the dining center? Is there a delivery option?	ALTERNATIVES: Have you considered...	"Having delivery options (Concordia mailbox, dorm room, etc...)"
REINFORCEMENT: I like that...	Cool and original idea for a project! I like the idea of having all of those Concordia stores in one place	IMPROVEMENT: I wish that...  It would be cool if...	It would be cool if you could add a search bar to your simulated site so if someone knows what they want they can just search for it!	UNCLEAR: I'm unsure about... Could you explain more about...	I'm not sure how cash payments can be accepted online. Maybe have an input to take in credit card information or a way to take it out of someone's Concordia account?	ALTERNATIVES: Have you considered...	Maybe have a way for someone to be able to pay when they go to pick up their product or a way to have the product delivered to them.
REINFORCEMENT: I like that...	I like the plan for making the website. 	IMPROVEMENT: I wish that...  It would be cool if...	"It would cool to search for items by which store or place you would normally find the item. Like a tab for the Maize, a tab for the Bookstore, etc."	UNCLEAR: I'm unsure about... Could you explain more about...	"It was not explicitly talked about, but do you have a way for users to see what they have in their cart and change the number of items in the cart?"	ALTERNATIVES: Have you considered...	"As I previously mentioned, a way to see the items in the cart and make changes to the cart from that screen would be cool. "
REINFORCEMENT: I like that...	I like that you have a good idea of what you want to do going forward. I also like that you are innovating on something that already exists.	IMPROVEMENT: I wish that...  It would be cool if...	"I think it would be cool if your did add actual links to things on the bookstore website. Like if you have something in your program that is actually on the store site, clicking that item actually brings the user to that item on the site."	UNCLEAR: I'm unsure about... Could you explain more about...	How did you get the interface in java to easily make the frame with the buttons on it. When you were showing the code there was something that you used to create the frame which I though was really interesting but it was kind of just glossed over.	ALTERNATIVES: Have you considered...	Have you considered trying to integrate it with an actual website possibly.
REINFORCEMENT: I like that...	you are handling a real-world problem. This is a really interesting idea and would be cool to actually implement something like this. I really like your group mentality!	IMPROVEMENT: I wish that...  It would be cool if...	people could make a wishlist or a separate 'cart' from the purchasing cart. These don't need to be connected but it would be an interesting feature. 	UNCLEAR: I'm unsure about... Could you explain more about...	how will the purchasing would work? I don't understand how the items in the 'basket' will work. I wonder if it could be something like an array list?	ALTERNATIVES: Have you considered...	"instead of connecting j-frames, changing the j-frame 'image' based on the user's actions. Kinda like user funtions on an invisible grid over a jpg."
REINFORCEMENT: I like that...	I like that there is a clear code structure. 	IMPROVEMENT: I wish that...  It would be cool if...	I wish that they ran the demo from NetBeans to see what it would really look like in a jFrame. 	UNCLEAR: I'm unsure about... Could you explain more about...	"Since this is supposed to be a website, how can this be transferred into an actual website from the program?"	ALTERNATIVES: Have you considered...	Possibly making a demo publicly accessible for the project.
REINFORCEMENT: I like that...	I like that you have you are planning on having the j-frames linked together.	IMPROVEMENT: I wish that...  It would be cool if...	It would be cool if you had a way for customers to add to a cart.	UNCLEAR: I'm unsure about... Could you explain more about...	I'm unsure if you have a shopping cart function that will hold everything you want to buy and a way to remove the item from the cart.	ALTERNATIVES: Have you considered...	Have you considered making it so that the website can see the supply that the store has and if it is sold out it lets the customer know?
REINFORCEMENT: I like that...	This is very well organized and seems very useful to the school.	IMPROVEMENT: I wish that...  It would be cool if...	It would be cool if you actually got the school to help you get stuff into the store or make it official and use it somehow.	UNCLEAR: I'm unsure about... Could you explain more about...	Im not sure if this is going to every be useful considering the school already has a website for that.	ALTERNATIVES: Have you considered...	"I don't really know how you can use java for creating a website. I learned HTML and CSS and javascript, I don't know what else you can use to create websites."
REINFORCEMENT: I like that...	I like that your website not just only sells our school stuff but also going to sells other multiple things.	IMPROVEMENT: I wish that...  It would be cool if...	"I wish that have an app for smartphone and  It would be cool if your code is going to be published on Github.

 "	UNCLEAR: I'm unsure about... Could you explain more about...	I am totally clear about what you guys are doing just hope for your final code to see how it works.	ALTERNATIVES: Have you considered...	Have you considered making a startup with this?
REINFORCEMENT: I like that...	The idea is really fresh and useful	IMPROVEMENT: I wish that...  It would be cool if...	Adding more design to the website	UNCLEAR: I'm unsure about... Could you explain more about...	How would we connect JFrames?	ALTERNATIVES: Have you considered...	Adding more items to choose from
REINFORCEMENT: I like that...	I like that you all decided to work on a website. I think cobber bookstore certainly need an upgrade. 	IMPROVEMENT: I wish that...  It would be cool if...	I wish that your book store had a different aesthetics.  It would have been cool if it was more minimalist and modern. 	UNCLEAR: I'm unsure about... Could you explain more about...	I am unsure about food ordering aspect of your website considering cobber bookstore doesn't sell food. Could you clarify or maybe consider refining the content of your website? 	ALTERNATIVES: Have you considered...	" 

Have you considered adding a live chat button or contact us button to your website."
REINFORCEMENT: I like that...	-	IMPROVEMENT: I wish that...  It would be cool if...	-	UNCLEAR: I'm unsure about... Could you explain more about...	-	ALTERNATIVES: Have you considered...	-
